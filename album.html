At the beginning, I feel sad because i am alone here. Knowing that i am introvert, i found it is difficult to make friends with others especially when it was an online learning. But alhamudilillah, when the learning back to a normal face- to-face, now i own a small circle, Syara and Alia. They help me a lot during this degree journey, and always checking up on me. even though, i am not too close to my classmates but still, they are so supportive. Hopefully, we can end our degree happily and graduated with a first class awarded. This degree life would never be this enjoyable without the existance of them. </font>
